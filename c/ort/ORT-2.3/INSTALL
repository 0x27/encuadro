WHAT DO I NEED TO COMPILE THE STUFF ?

	X11R4/5 which is only used for the displayer so if you
	comment out the line 

	(cd $(DSPDIR)/exe ; make -f Makefile CC="$(CC)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)" OTHERLIB="$(OTHERLIB)" X11DIR="$(X11DIR)")

	in the Makefile all should be OK.

HOW DO I BUILD THE S/W ?

	1. Decide whether you want to use the cc or gcc compiler
	2. Edit the Makefile in this directory and set CC to 
	   whatever you decided in 1. Eg if you want to use cc

#CC	= gcc
CC	= cc

	3. Just type make in this directory.

	4. If this fails then 

		a) Try looking in the main makefile where there are
		   some switches you can set

		b) If it fails because you are on a Decstations and
		   the X11 distribution is in a stupid place like 
		   /usr/include/mit/X11 or such-like. Then set the
		   correct path using X11DIR variable.

**** NOTE GCC VERSION 1.39 HAS A MAJOR BUG, USE GCC VERSION 1.37 OR 1.40 ****
**** TO FIND OUT THE VERSION OF GCC YOU HAVE TYPE: gcc -v                ****

HOW DO I BUILD THE DOCUMENTATION?

	A manpage is supplied for the Liste library. This is in Doc/man. 

IF YOU GOT THE DISTRIBUTION AS A COMPRESSED TARFILE:

	To make the papers you need

		a) LaTeX and BibTeX
		b) dvi2ps or some variation thereof which handles the
                 \special LaTeX command (see the final section for more info).

	If you have the above, edit the Makefile in the Doc/LaTeX directory
	and set DVITOPS to whatever it is you have at your site which
	does the job and DVIFLG to whatever flags your dvi converter needs. 
	Then type 

		make

MY DVITOPS IGNORES THE \special DIRECTIVE. WHAT DO I DO ?

	Either print out the postscript figures separately OR if you
	have some time to spare try:

	a) Add the command   \input{psfig}  just after   \documentstyle

	b) Edit instances of \begin{figure} to \end{figure} such as:

	\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\vspace*{-10mm}
	\special{psfile=Figures/Segmentation.ps}
	\vspace*{10cm}
	\vspace*{-5mm}
	\caption{Application of the segmentation pass to a chained set of pixels.}
	\label{fig:segmentation}
	\end{figure}

	And replace them thus:

	\begin{figure}[h]
	\psfig{figure=Figures/Segmentation.ps,width=12cm,height=10cm}
	\caption{Application of the segmentation pass to a chained set of pixels.}
	\label{fig:segmentation}
	\end{figure}
