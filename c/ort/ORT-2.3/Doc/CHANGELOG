Version 2.1:
   1. All programs are now default driven
   2. PGM format as standard with option for raw images
   3. Added new options to LPEG and IPEG
   4. IPEG is fully general and very much faster
   5. LPEG now has option to consider pairs of collinear lines as real lines

Version 2.3:
   1. Changed names of programs and converted to lowercase characters
   2. Added support for rectangular images
   3. Fixed problem with HUGE value being too big for some compilers (eg
      gcc on x86 PCs.)
   4. Now all programs (except ort2image) may be chained using Unix pipes
   5. The ID number assigned to Lines and Circular arcs is constant. Before I 
      used to change ID numbers when grouping the lines. This caused some
      people problems.
   6. All programs are faster (specially ipeg).
   7. Fixed problem (actually a C bug I think :) in ipeg which made it give
      segmentation fault for no reason. This was due the use of bcopy.
      Now only if you set the quality factor very low (eg 0.3) it usually 
      requires too much memory for average machines and crashes. Since I don't 
      know how to check for available memory on-the-fly I left this bug alone.
   8. Restructured the directories
   9. Added COPYRIGHT Notice to top of all C programs
