         ============================================
         Object Recognition Toolkit (ORT) Version 2.3
         ============================================

ORT is a collection of pixel grouping S/W in C aimed for use on Unix
platforms (Sun4, Decstation, Iris, X86 under Linux). Currently the 
starting point for ORT is an edge detected image. The S/W is in the 
form of filters and includes a displayer for use on COLOUR workstations 
under X11R4/5. All the S/W comes with the GNU general public licence. 
Also included are LaTeX copies of papers on some of the S/W (FEX, LPEG). 
Basically ORT allows you to create progressively more complex groupings 
of a set of edge pixels [lines/arcs -> parallel/collinear/junctions ->
triplets/corners/polygons]. Changes from previous versions are:

Version 2.1:
   1. All programs are now default driven
   2. PGM format as standard with option for raw images
   3. Added new options to LPEG and IPEG
   4. IPEG is fully general and very much faster
   5. LPEG now has option to consider pairs of collinear lines as real lines

Version 2.3:
   1. Changed names of programs and converted to lowercase characters
   2. Added support for rectangular images
   3. Fixed problem with HUGE value being too big for some compilers (eg
      gcc on 386 and 486PCs.)
   4. Now all programs (except ort2image) may be chained using Unix pipes
   5. The ID number assigned to Lines and Circular arcs is constant. Before I 
      used to change ID numbers when grouping the lines. This caused some
      people problems.
   6. All programs are faster (specially ipeg).
   7. Fixed problem (actually a C bug I think :) in ipeg which made it give
      segmentation fault for no reason. This was due the use of bcopy.
      Now only if you set the quality factor very low (eg 0.3) it usually 
      requires too much memory for average machines and crashes. Since I don't 
      know how to check for available memory on-the-fly I left this bug alone.
   8. Restructured the directories

The features defined within ORT represent the complete set required to 
recognize any polyhedral object (view point independently) starting from edge 
information. Available later this year will be an Edge detection module,
and hopefully also a generalised curve grouping system.

I would appreciate it if people who obtain the S/W drop me a line. All
contributions/comments to the distribution are most welcome. If you have
any problems I'll be glad to help.
