* OpenCv Samples

This directory contains examples for testing the board detection capability of the aruco library.
It contains the following files:
 - video.avi: video that shows a board
 - intrinsics.int: intrinsic information of the camera that recorded the video
 - intrinsics.yml: intrinsic information of the camera in the OpenCv format
 - boardinfo.abc: configuration of the board shown in the video. It contains the id of the markers in the boards as well as its arrangement
 - board.png: printable image of the board
 - image-test.png: a sample image



In order to test the library with these files you can use :

- aruco_simple_board: the simplest example. 
      Run it as:  > aruco_simple_board image-test.png boardinfo.abc intrinsics.yml 0.039
- aruco_test_board: a more sohpisticated example
     Run it as:  > aruco_test_board -i  video.avi -b  boardinfo.abc -i  intrinsics.int -s 0.039
     or as :  > aruco_test_board -i  video.avi -b  boardinfo.abc -y  intrinsics.yml -s 0.039
- aruco_test_board_gl: example showing how to use OpenGL
     Run it as:  > aruco_test_board_gl -i video.avi -b boardinfo.abc -f intrinsics.int -s 0.039
     or   as:  > aruco_test_board_gl -i video.avi -b boardinfo.abc -y intrinsics.yml -s 0.039



Enjoy!
